CS4200: Compiler Construction Project Template
======

This repository contains a template which allows students to implement
labs for the CS4200 using a text editor or IDE of their own choice. Be
aware that this template is provided by the course staff on a best
effort basis and that no official support will be given. It is
therefore recommended that assignments are done on Brightspace
instead.

> **Warning**
>  Please do not forget to hand-in **all** assignments using
> Brightspace, otherwise they *cannot* and *will not* be graded.
